    "The aim of this project is to distinguish short segments of an EEG signal recorded in a subject whose eyes are either closed or open. In other words, you will train a binary classifier taking as input (features extracted from) a 500 ms EEG signal and for wich the prediction is the state of the subject (either eyes closed or open). To reach this goal, you will work on a real dataset recoded in the laboratory of Woluwe. Unforntunately, the data recorded this year during the EEG+TMS lab are not usable for this project due to recording issues. You will have to work on other recordings.</b> <br>\n",

First, you will be asked to extract segments of 500 ms out of the recorded EEG waves. During each segment, the state of the subject (eyes open or closed) must be constant. Based on these segments, you will extract some usefull features that will help to summarize the information content in those 500 ms signals. Then, you will train a classifier to predict whether a given new segment belongs to the \"eyes open\" or the \"eyes closed\" class. You will have to predict the performances you can obtain with this classification model.\n",
